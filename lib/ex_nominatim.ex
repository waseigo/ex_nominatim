  Main user-friendly functions for interacting with the endpoints of a Nominatim API server.

  The `opts` keyword list of the endpoint request functions can optionally include the following:
  * `:base_url` with a string value setting the base URL of the target Nominatim API server (it defaults to the public server).
  * `:force` with a boolean value, where `true` means that validation errors will be ignored and the HTTP GET request to the API will run regardless.

  > #### Warning {: .error}

  > Please respect the [Nominatim Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/) when using the public server. To prevent useless requests, it is recommended to not disable request validation.

    **New since v2.0.0:** ExNominatim can be configured as defined using the `Config` module. You can define default values like so:

  ```elixir
  config :ex_nominatim, ExNominatim,
    all: [
      base_url: "http://localhost:8080",
      force: true,
      format: "json",
      process: true,
      atomize: true
    ],
    search: [format: "geocodejson", force: false],
    reverse: [namedetails: 1],
    lookup: [],
    details: [],
    status: [format: "json"]
  ```

  The configuration above has the following effects:

  * Requests to all endpoints will use the self-hosted Nominatim API instance at port 8080 of `localhost`, accessible over HTTP.
  * Request parameter validation errors (`valid?: false` in the request parameters struct) will be ignored for requests to all endpoints, except for requests to the `/search` endpoint.
  * Unless requested otherwise in `opts`, requests to the `/search` endpoint will return data in GeocodeJSON format (instead of the default `jsonv2`).
  * Requests to the `/reverse` endpoint will set `:namedetails` to 1 (unless otherwise set in `opts`).
  * Requests to the `/status` endpoint will return JSON instead of the [default text](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Status/#output) (HTTP status code 200 and text `OK` or HTTP status 500 and a detailed error mesage).
  * The responses from all endpoints will be processed automatically using `ExNominatim.Report.process/1`, and any maps and contents thereof (or map contents of structs's keys) will be converted from bitstring keys to atom keys using `ExNominatim.Report.atomize/1`.

  Here's the preference order:

  * The default values for `:base_url` and `:force` across all endpoints are the public Nominatim API server's URL and `false`, respectively.
  * Any keyword-value pairs set in the `:all` list override these defaults and are applied automatically in requests to all endpoints.
  * Any keyword-value pairs set in the list of a specific endpoint override any values defined in the `:all` list and are applied automatically in requests to that endpoint.
  * Anything you set in `opts` overrides all the above.

  At any moment you can use `ExNominatim.get_config/0` to see the current configuration.

  The following things are set as default in ExNominatim's default settings (unless overriden through your own configuration or explicitly-set request parameter values):
  1. The `:format` value for the `/reverse` endpoint, which is switched to GeocodeJSON, instead of XML (the API endpoint's default).
  2. The `:format` value for the `/lookup` endpoint, which is switched to JSONv2, instead of XML (the API endpoint's default).
  3. The `:format` value for the `/status` endpoint, which is switch to JSON, instead of text (the API endpoint's default).
